## Title

The title of this game is `Pirate Wars`!

## Intent

Our intent for this game is to continue building upon the previous labs. This time we are intending to create a 3D world with active NPCs that navigate using NavMeshes. This also makes us build on the animations that have been used before-- instead of 2D animations we have 3D ones.

## Narrative

You and your swashbuckling crew must defend your territory in the high seas against the brigands who hope to rip it from you! Oh no! The cannons arenâ€™t working! Throw your cannonballs to sink the enemy rafts! Fight through the three waves and claim the throne of the high seas! 

## Mechanics



## Aesthetics

Since this is a pirate game, we went with pirate themed music and font. We used wooden planks and sign posts to represent buttons and textboxes respectively. The boats are generally boats that would be sailed and commandeered by pirates, so we chose them as well!

## Joys and Struggles

Honestly, several members had SEVERE issues with some of the software that we used for the project. One could not download the unity assets from the unity asset store, and another was only able to push a few changes at a time using gitkraken. Other than those large ones, getting code to work and seemlessly function is always a struggle. One of the joys we had was seeing the water shader in action.
